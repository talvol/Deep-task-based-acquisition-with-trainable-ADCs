# Deep Task-Based Acquisition with Trainable ADCs

This project includes two distinct works in the field of task-based learning for neuromorphic ADCs. 

1. **Noiseless Scenario**: In this scenario, we propose a learning method for jointly tuning the internal ADC memristors and the surrounding signal processing stages to optimize classification performance under power constraints. The project includes two scripts demonstrating our improved accuracy-power tradeoff compared to traditional uniform ADCs.

2. **Noisy Scenario**: In the expanded version of the project, we introduced noise during the inference phase and explored methods to improve system performance under noisy conditions. By utilizing noisy training and knowledge distillation, we achieved significant improvements. This scenario includes three scripts demonstrating our system's superior performance compared to traditional uniform ADCs, even in noisy environments.
