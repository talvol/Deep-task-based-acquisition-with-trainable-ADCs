# Deep-task-based-acquisition-with-trainable-ADCs
In this work we proposed a learning method for jointly tuning the internal ADC memristors and the preceding and subsequent signal processing to optimize classification performance under power constraints.
The project includes two scripts for two different scenarios that demonstrate our improved accuracy-power tradeoff compared with traditional uniform ADC.
